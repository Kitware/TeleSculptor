The TeleSculptor software uses a standard installer package on Windows. To install, double click the installer icon and step through the installation steps as shown in the images 
below. This will require administrative privileges. The name of the 64-bit Windows installer is **TeleSculptor-1.1.0-Windows-AMD64.exe**.

Once the application is open you can access additional documentation about the various features in the User Manual which is opened from the *Help* menu or by pressing the F1 shortcut 
key.  The User Manual will open in your default web browser.  The User Manual does not yet provide step-by-step instructions, as this document does, but it does provide more detailed 
descriptions of each of the buttons and menu options.

SketchUp Plugin Installation
==============================

The TeleSculptor application also comes with a plugin for SketchUp that allows SketchUp to read TeleSculptor project files.  This is not installed automatically.  To install the 
SketchUp plugin, first locate the plugin in your TeleSculptor installation.  If TeleSculptor is installed in the default location, you will find the plugin at 

**C:\Program Files\TeleSculptor 1.1.0\share\telesculptor\1.1.0\plugins\sketchup\kw_telesculptor.rbz**

To install this plug in SketchUp, first open SketchUp.  Next navigate to the *Window->Preferences* menu as shown in the figure below.  Within the *System Preferences* dialog, click 
on Extensions in the menu on the left.  Now click the Install Extension button at the bottom of the dialog.  Use the file open dialog to locate the kw_telesculptor.rbz file at the 
location above and click the Open button.  Administrative privileges are needed to complete the installation.  Once installed “TeleSculptor Importer” will appear in the Extensions 
list and the box next to it should be checked to activate the plugin.  The plugin may not be fully active until the SketchUp application is closed and re-opened.
