MAP-Tk v0.9.0 Release Notes
==========================

This is a minor release of MAP-Tk that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v0.8.0 release.  However, MAP-Tk is still considered
pre-release software and subject to significant API changes.


Updates since v0.8.0
---------------------------------

MAP-Tk Library

 * Removed the standalone canonical_transform() function in transform.h in
   favor of an abstract algorithm with implementation in the core plugin.

Core Plugin

 * Added a new algorithm for canonical transform with the implementation
   details moved from the function that was in transform.h.

 * Added a new loop closure algorithm implementation that searches for
   matches in a local neighborhood and then establishes keyframes for
   long term loop closure outside that neighborhood.  This algorithm
   is generally slower than others, but can be configured to produce
   considerably more dense match matrices with longer tracks.  It also handles
   long term loop closure without any assumption about planar scenes.

VXL Plugin

 * Added a new algorithm for canonical transform which uses robust estimation
   (e.g. RANSAC, LMS, IRLS) from the Rensselaer robust estimation library
   (rrel) in VXL to fit a ground plane to the data.  The ground plane becomes
   the Z=0 plane.  The rest of the free parameters are then fit by PCA as in
   the core plugin implementation.

Visualization Application

 * Updated the "Align" tool to use the configurable abstract algorithm
   for canonical transform.

 * Added an option to display the world axes around the visible geometry.
   This option can be enabled and disabled in the "View" menu.

 * Added an option to export the current scene to webGL. This option is only
   available if VTK was built with the option Module_vtkWebGLExporter turned on.
   This option can then be found in the "File > Export" menu.

 * The absolute path to the current frame is now displayed at the bottom of the
   Camera view.

 * The GUI now accepts a list of files to be opened on the command line.

Tools

 * Updated the bundle_adjust_tracks tool to use the configurable abstract
   algorithm for canonical transform.

 * Added an option to the bundle_adjust_tracks tool to remove all the KRTD
   files from the output directory before writing new ones.  This is useful
   when only a subset of cameras are computed and we do not want a mix of
   old and new camera files.

 * Added command line arguments to get help (-h, --help) and to open directly a
   config file at launch (-i, --input [PATH])
