MAP-Tk v0.9.0 Release Notes
==========================

This is a minor release of MAP-Tk that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v0.8.0 release.  However, MAP-Tk is still considered
pre-release software and subject to significant API changes.


Updates since v0.8.0
---------------------------------

MAP-Tk Library

 * Removed the standalone canonical_transform() function in transform.h in
   favor of an abstract algorithm with implementation in the core plugin.

Core Plugin

 * Added a new algorithm for canonical transform with the implementation
   details moved from the function that was in transform.h.

VXL Plugin

 * Added a new algorithm for canonical transform which uses robust estimation
   (e.g. RANSAC, LMS, IRLS) from the Rensselaer robust estimation library
   (rrel) in VXL to fit a ground plane to the data.  The ground plane becomes
   the Z=0 plane.  The rest of the free parameters are then fit by PCA as in
   the core plugin implementation.

Visualization Application

 * Updated the "Align" tool to use the configurable abstract algorithm
   for canonical transform.

Tools

 * Updated the bundle_adjust_tracks tool to use the configurable abstract
   algorithm for canonical transform.


Fixes since v0.8.0
