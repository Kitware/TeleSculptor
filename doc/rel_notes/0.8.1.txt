MAP-Tk v0.8.1 Release Notes
===========================

This release provides patches to the MAP-Tk v0.8.0 release to address issues.
MAP-Tk v0.8.1 is a bug fix release with no new functionality.


Updates since v0.8.0
--------------------

Scripts

 * The SketchUp import script now loads MAP-Tk landmarks into a new layer.


Fixes since v0.8.0
--------------------

VXL Plugin

 * Updated the CMake code for using VXL to handle changes in VXL master so that
   MAP-Tk can build against the latest VXL.  The lastest VXL master uses
   VXL_CORE_INCLUDE_DIRS instead of VXL_CORE_INCLUDE_DIR to specify multiple
   include directories (e.g. in source and build trees).  This is needed to
   find configured headers that are in the build tree.  The same is true for
   VXL_VCL_INCLUDE_DIRS.  MAP-Tk has been fixed to use *_INCLUDE_DIRS when
   available.

MAP-Tk GUI

 * Failing to parse a config block in the GUI was not reporting any message.
   The GUI now catches config exception and prints a warning message.  This
   is a temporary solution until a proper error dialog is implemented.

 * Fixed an issue with the ground plane disappearing after loading data that
   did not include landmarks.  The ground plane now uses the cameras for scale
   when only cameras are in the world view and no longer disappears when the
   only data loaded is in the image view.

Tools

 * Fixed an issue with converting POS filenames to KRTD in the pos2krtd tool.
   When producing the KRTD filenames from the POS file names, the pos2krtd
   tool was being too agressive about striping file extensions when more
   than one '.' was in the file name.  In this release the tool strips the
   extension at the last '.' instead of the first.

Scripts

 * Fixed a bug in the SketchUp import script was loading MAP-Tk data assuming
   units of inches instead of meters.

 * Worked around an issue in the Sketchup import script in which SketchUp was
   limiting the FOV of cameras to greater than 1 degree.  The loading script
   now adjusts the image width and focal length parameter to force FOV less
   than 1 degree when needed.
