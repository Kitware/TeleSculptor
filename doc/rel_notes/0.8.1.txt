Fixes since v0.8.0
--------------------

VXL Plugin

 * Updated the CMake code for using VXL to handle changes in VXL master so that
   MAP-Tk can build against the latest VXL.  The lastest VXL master uses
   VXL_CORE_INCLUDE_DIRS instead of VXL_CORE_INCLUDE_DIR to specify multiple
   include directories (e.g. in source and build trees).  This is needed to
   find configured headers that are in the build tree.  The same is true for
   VXL_VCL_INCLUDE_DIRS.  MAP-Tk has been fixed to use *_INCLUDE_DIRS when
   available.

MAP-Tk GUI

 * Failing to parse a config block in the GUI was not reporting any message.
   The GUI now catches config exception and prints a warning message.  This
   is a temporary solution until a proper error dialog is implemented.

Tools

 * Fixed an issue with converting POS filenames to KRTD in the pos2krtd tool.
   When producing the KRTD filenames from the POS file names, the pos2krtd
   tool was being too agressive about striping file extensions when more
   than one '.' was in the file name.  In this release the tool strips the
   extension at the last '.' instead of the first.
