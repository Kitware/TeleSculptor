issues. TeleSculptor v1.1.2 is a bug fix release with no new functionality.


Fixes since v1.1.1
------------------

TeleSculptor Application

 * Fixed Batch Compute Depth Maps tool to only save final depth maps and not
   intermediate results.  This prevents intermediate results from accidentally
   overwriting final results.

 * Fixed the display of color mapped data when non-finitie values are present
   in the data.  The data range is now set using only the finite values.
