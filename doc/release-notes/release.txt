Fixes since v1.0.0
------------------

Build System

 * Updated Fletch to fix broken Qt 5.11 URL.

 * Fixed broken PDAL support.  PDAL was disabled regardless of the CMake
   setting due to a mis-named variable.

TeleSculptor Application

 * Updated "About" dialog github URL from maptk to TeleSculptor.

 * Fixed a bug in translating the ROI when shifting the geo-origin point.
   Previously the ROI was collapsing because both the min and max point were
   set to the translated min point.

 * Fixed a bug in which GCPs or ruler end points would render in random
   locations in the camera view if the world location was behind the
   camera.  The GCPs or ruler for invalid projections are no longer drawn.

 * Fixed a bug in which GCPs imported from a file after a camera was loaded
   were imported twice.

 * Fixed an issues with location precision of landmarks in the Camera View that
   occured when some points project very far from the image.  These points are
   now filtered out.
