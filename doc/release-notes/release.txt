TeleSculptor v1.1.2 Release Notes
=================================

This release provides patches to the TeleSculptor v1.1.1 release to address
issues. TeleSculptor v1.1.2 is a bug fix release with no new functionality.


Fixes since v1.1.1
------------------

TeleSculptor Application

 * Coloring landmarks by height previously set the automatic range for the
   colormap to the entire height range, which is not very useful since
   most data sets have outliers.  This has been corrected such that the
   auto range of the colormap spans the middle 90% of the height values.

 * Fixed an issue with not saving project state after loading a video.
   If TeleSculptor was closed after loading a video but before other
   processing, the project would not remember which video was loaded.

 * Fixed Batch Compute Depth Maps tool to only save final depth maps and not
   intermediate results.  This prevents intermediate results from accidentally
   overwriting final results.

 * Fixed the display of color mapped data when non-finitie values are present
   in the data.  The data range is now set using only the finite values.
