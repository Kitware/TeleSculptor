TeleSculptor v1.1.1 Release Notes
=================================

This release provides patches to the TeleSculptor v1.1.0 release to address
issues. TeleSculptor v1.1.1 is a bug fix release with no new functionality.


Fixes since v1.1.0
------------------

TeleSculptor Application

 * Fixed a crash that occured when opening a bad video file.
   TeleSculptor now handles the failure to load without crashing.

 * Fixed a crash that happens when running end-to-end immediately after
   feature tracking completes.

 * Fixed an issue where cameras and depth maps in a project file were
   not loaded when opening a project that uses an image list instead of
   a video file.  This was because the metadata scan needs to complete
   first to index the image file names for each frame.  Cameras and depth
   maps are now loaded after the metadata scan is complete if not already
   loaded earlier.

Testing

 * Updated Travis CI scripts to use the same KWIVER hash as specified in
   the TeleSculptor superbuild.  Previously it was building the KWIVER master
   branch, which might not have been compatible with the TeleSculptor branch
   being tested.
