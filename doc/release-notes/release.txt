------------------

Build System

 * Updated Fletch to fix broken Qt 5.11 URL.

 * Fixed broken PDAL support.  PDAL was disabled regardless of the CMake
   setting due to a mis-named variable.

TeleSculptor Application

 * Updated "About" dialog github URL from maptk to TeleSculptor.

 * Fixed a bug in translating the ROI when shifting the geo-origin point.
   Previously the ROI was collapsing because both the min and max point were
   set to the translated min point.

   occured when some points project very far from the image.  These points are
   now filtered out.
