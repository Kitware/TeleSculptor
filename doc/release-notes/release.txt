Fixes since v1.1.1
------------------

TeleSculptor Application

 * Coloring landmarks by height previously set the automatic range for the
   colormap to the entire height range, which is not very useful since
   most data sets have outliers.  This has been corrected such that the
   auto range of the colormap spans the middle 90% of the height values.

 * Fixed an issue with not saving project state after loading a video.
   If TeleSculptor was closed after loading a video but before other
   processing, the project would not remember which video was loaded.

 * Fixed Batch Compute Depth Maps tool to only save final depth maps and not
   intermediate results.  This prevents intermediate results from accidentally
   overwriting final results.

 * Fixed Run End-to-End tool to properly save depth maps after disabling the
   writing of intermediate results.

 * Fixed the display of color mapped data when non-finite values are present
   in the data.  The data range is now set using only the finite values.

 * Fixed warning in new versions of CMake about conversion of TYPE to STRING.

 * Fixed an issue with the Camera View not properly updating the visualization
   of landmarks when landmarks change during tool updates.

 * Fixed an issue in which std::isfinite is not resolved with some compilers
   due to the missing cmath header.

Packaging

 * Fix bug in creating TeleSculptor package on Windows with vc16.  The search
   path for OpenCV DLLs included only vc14 and vc15.  It now will look for any
   vc version.
