Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Added an option to the Ground Control Points panel to apply the GCP
   constraints to correct for georegistration.  The apply button estimates
   a 3D similarity transform that best aligns the GCPs with their specified
   geodetic locations (latitude, longitude, elevation).  The estimated
   transform is then applied to all the data to georegister.

 * When selecting a subset of video frames in the track features tool the
   algorithm now selects first from the subset of frames which have camera
   geometry metadata before filling in with other valid frames without
   metadata. This gives priority to frames which have metadata.


Fixes since last public release
