TeleSculptor Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=======================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to TeleSculptor which
require public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Added an option to the Ground Control Points panel to apply the GCP
   constraints to correct for georegistration.  The apply button estimates
   a 3D similarity transform that best aligns the GCPs with their specified
   geodetic locations (latitude, longitude, elevation).  The estimated
   transform is then applied to all the data to georegister.

 * When selecting a subset of video frames in the track features tool the
   algorithm now considers modifying each selection slightly to give
   priority to picking nearby frames which have camera metadata.

 * Changed feature tracking configuration to use non-maximum suppression to
   achieve a better spatial distribution of features when contrast is unevenly
   distributed across the image.

 * Switched from homography to fundamental matrix as the default geometric
   filter in feature matching.  The fundamental matrix supports more general
   scenes and does not require a planar scene or small motion assumption.

 * Improved speed of metadata access and loading.

 * Estimate focal length during structure from motion.  This option was
   previously disabled by default.

 * TeleSculptor now loads all video frames and metadata by default instead
   of sampling every 10th frame as in the past.  This is feasible because
   the feature tracking now downsamples frames to a reasonable amount instead.

 * Added support for bundle adjustment callbacks that do not update the GUI
   state.  This allows the initializer tool to support early termination
   without making it run slower.

 * Added new option "ignore_metadata" to force the camera estimation
   algorithms to ignore the KLV metadata.  This is useful if the metadata is
   known to be incorrect.

 * Added an option to write out the fused mesh as OBJ. Currently this option
   supports only the mesh and does not write color per vertex.

 * The ruler tool now supports constrained measurements on the vertical (Z)
   axis by holding the "z" key or in the horizontal (X-Y) plane by holding
   either the "x" or "y" keys.

 * The ruler tool now behaves like a ruler with a fixed tick unit distance.
   Dragging the ruler progressively increases the number of ruler ticks.

 * The user can set the ruler tick distance and color via a popup menu next to
   the ruler measurement button.

 * Improve responsiveness and information in progress bar for Compute Depth
   tool.

 * Improved the information in the progress bar for Initialize Cameras and
   Landmarks tool.

 * TeleSculptor now uses image masks in the depth estimation tools if image
   masks have been loaded.  Masks indicate which pixels to ignore in depth
   estimation.

 * TeleSculptor now uses image masks in the depth fusion tool if image masks
   have been loaded.

 * The tool to batch compute depth maps now provides more frequent status
   updates and intermediate results.  The cancel option is also more
   responsive.

 * The auxiliary data fields provided along with depth maps and shown in the
   depth map viewer have been renamed.  "Best Cost" and "UniquenessRatio" have
   been replaced with "Weight" and "Uncertainty".  The previous names were
   specific to an older algorithm that is no longer used.  Weight is an image
   of zero to one values indicating how much each pixel contributes to the
   final fused model.  One use case for weight is the use of masks to disable
   contribution for some pixels.  Uncertainty is not used yet but is a place
   holder for measurements of how uncertain the depth estimate is each pixel.

 * Added a menu for compute options including the option to specify whether
   or not to use metadata as constraints in computations and an option to
   specify whether or not to allow variable (e.g. zooming, swapping) lens.

 * Added a special "Run End-to-End" tool to the compute menu that runs a
   pipeline of all main tools in order to start from a video and end with
   a fused 3D surface mesh without any user interaction.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Fixed a divide-by-zero bug caused by computing the mean landmark location
   when there are zero landmarks.  This happened when recomputing the local
   coordinate system without landmarks.

 * Improved placement of ground control points and ruler tool based on picking
   the closest cell or point in the scene along the camera direction.

 * Fixed a crash that occurred when applying a color gradient to data with all
   the same value.  This occurred when selecting to visualize Uncertainty of
   depth maps which is currently unused and all zeros.  Likewise with Weights
   of depth maps when no mask is used.
