TeleSculptor Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=======================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to TeleSculptor which
require public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Added an option to write out the fused mesh as OBJ. Currently this option
   supports only the mesh and does not write color per vertex.

 * The ruler tool now supports constrained measurements on the vertical (Z)
   axis by holding the "z" key or in the horizontal (X-Y) plane by holding
   either the "x" or "y" keys.

 * Improve responsiveness and information in progress bar for Compute Depth
   tool.

 * TeleSculptor now uses image masks in the depth estimation tools if image
   masks have been loaded.  Masks indicate which pixels to ignore in depth
   estimation.

 * TeleSculptor now uses image masks in the depth fusion tool if image masks
   have been loaded.

 * The tool to batch compute depth maps now provides more frequent status
   updates and intermediate results.  The cancel option is also more
   responsive.

 * The auxiliary data fields provided along with depth maps and shown in the
   depth map viewer have been renamed.  "Best Cost" and "UniquenessRatio" have
   been replaced with "Weight" and "Uncertainty".  The previous names were
   specific to an older algorithm that is no longer used.  Weight is an image
   of zero to one values indicating how much each pixel contributes to the
   final fused model.  One use case for weight is the use of masks to disable
   contribution for some pixels.  Uncertainty is not used yet but is a place
   holder for measurements of how uncertain the depth estimate is each pixel.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

TeleSculptor

* Improved placement of ground control points and ruler tool based on picking
  the closest cell or point in the scene along the camera direction.
