=======================================================================

Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Added an option to the Ground Control Points panel to apply the GCP
   constraints to correct for georegistration.  The apply button estimates
   a 3D similarity transform that best aligns the GCPs with their specified
   geodetic locations (latitude, longitude, elevation).  The estimated
   transform is then applied to all the data to georegister.

 * When selecting a subset of video frames in the track features tool the
   algorithm now considers modifying each selection slightly to give
   priority to picking nearby frames which have camera metadata.

 * Improved speed of metadata access and loading.

 * TeleSculptor now loads all video frames and metadata by default instead
   of sampling every 10th frame as in the past.  This is feasible because
   the feature tracking now downsamples frames to a reasonable amount instead.
