TeleSculptor v1.2.0 Release Notes
=================================

This is a minor release of TeleSculptor that provides both new functionality
and fixes over the previous v1.1.0 release.


Updates since v1.1.0
--------------------

TeleSculptor Application

 * Move computation of mesh coloring to a separate thread to prevent it from
   blocking GUI interaction while running.

 * Display a progress bar when coloring the mesh using more than just the
   current frame.

 * Added an option to mesh coloring that excludes coloring surfaces that are
   occluded from the camera's viewpoint.  This prevent colors on closer
   surfaces from also spilling onto the hidden surfaces behind them.

 * Added an option to mesh coloring that excludes coloring surfaces using
   pixels masked out by the loaded mask image sequence.

 * Added an option to export the fused mesh as a VTP file including the colors
   projected from all frames instead of only the mean or median color.

 * Updated depth computation tools to return uncertainty images to be displayed
   and saved.

 * Update Depth Map and Batch Depth Map estimation tools to select the
   support frames based on a new angle_span parameter rather than
   sequential frames.  This allows more consistent angular sampling
   of frames.

 * Added support for building against VTK 9.0.

 * Added an option to import PLY mesh files like those exported from
   TeleSculptor

 * Added support for opening .ts (MPEG transport stream) video files.

 * Added keyboard shortcuts to change frames and to change the selected ground
   control point.

Tools

 * Removed deprecated command line maptk tools. All the underlying kwiver
   algoritms can be accessed via the 'kwiver' command line tool.

Build System

 * The superbuild now allows using system packages for many dependencies.
