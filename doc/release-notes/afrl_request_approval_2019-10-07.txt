TeleSculptor Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=======================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to TeleSculptor which
require public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Added an option to the Ground Control Points panel to apply the GCP
   constraints to correct for georegistration.  The apply button estimates
   a 3D similarity transform that best aligns the GCPs with their specified
   geodetic locations (latitude, longitude, elevation).  The estimated
   transform is then applied to all the data to georegister.

 * When selecting a subset of video frames in the track features tool the
   algorithm now considers modifying each selection slightly to give
   priority to picking nearby frames which have camera metadata.

 * Changed feature tracking configuration to use non-maximum suppression to
   achieve a better spatial distribution of features when contrast is unevenly
   distributed across the image.

 * Switched from homography to fundamental matrix as the default geometric
   filter in feature matching.  The fundamental matrix supports more general
   scenes and does not require a planar scene or small motion assumption.

 * Improved speed of metadata access and loading.

 * Estimate focal length during structure from motion.  This option was
   previously disabled by default.

 * TeleSculptor now loads all video frames and metadata by default instead
   of sampling every 10th frame as in the past.  This is feasible because
   the feature tracking now downsamples frames to a reasonable amount instead.

 * Added support for bundle adjustment callbacks that do not update the GUI
   state.  This allows the initializer tool to support early termination
   without making it run slower.

 * Added new option "ignore_metadata" to force the camera estimation
   algorithms to ignore the KLV metadata.  This is useful if the metadata is
   known to be incorrect.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Fixed a divide-by-zero bug caused by computing the mean landmark location
   when there are zero landmarks.  This happened when recomputing the local
   coordinate system without landmarks.
