We recommend that new users try one of the following videos released as part
of the `VIRAT Video Dataset`_. You will need to accept the Terms of Use before

workflows, please see the `User Guide <../doc/TeleSculptor-v1.1-User-Guide.pdf>`_.


09172008flight1tape3_2.mpg_: The aircraft makes about one complete orbit over
a site in Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. The stare point remains fixed on the center
of the scene and the field of view is quite narrow. The scene is composed
primarily of buildings and vehicles.

09152008flight2tape2_4.mpg_: This is video of the same region but taken in a
different style. The field of view is much larger and the stare point moves
substantially. In addition to the buildings and vehicles which are the focus of
the other clip, this video includes wide shots of roads and vegetation.

If you are considering running TeleSculptor on different data, there are several things to
keep in mind. The first is that TeleSculptor is optimized for aerial data and
results may vary on data collected in other ways.
Additionally, the way to data is captured has a significant impact on the
quality of the model. It is important to have multiple views of the same regions
from different directions and if possible the camera should complete a full rotation about the scene.
It is best not to change the zoom of your lens and if you do it should be done
slowly and gradually. Finally, you should avoid switching between different
modalities, for example recording part of your video in color and the rest in infrared.
If you are capturing images rather than video, it is important that there is
substantial overlap in the content seen between different images.
